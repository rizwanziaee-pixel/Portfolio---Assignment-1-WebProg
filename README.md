Done and Designed using HTML5 and CSS3 within Visual Studio Code.

##  GUI / Interface

### a) Responsiveness
- **≤ 480px (mobile):** Covers most modern smartphones.  
- **481–1024px (tablet):** Fits common tablets in portrait and landscape.

Separate CSS files (`mobile.css`, `tablet.css`) control typography, navigation layout, and content width.

Chosen with **Adobe Color** for consistency and readability.
